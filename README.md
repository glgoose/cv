## Customize your Résumé

To edit the content and design of your résumé, follow these steps:

### 1. Personal Details

Open `src/data/author.json` and edit the information describing yourself. The following properties are supported:

<table></table>

### 2. Introduction

Open `src/introduction.md` and edit the text content of the file with your personal short introduction summary. Limit it to 2-3 sentences and convey your motivation.

Leave the `layout` and `permalink` data at the top in place, and save the file.

### 3. Work Experience & Education

The entries for the sections "work experience" and "education" are stored as markdown files in `src/entries/work` and `src/entries/education`.

Delete the demo files in there and create your own. Include the following [frontmatter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) data:

<table></table>

### 4. Meta Data & Design

Open `src/data/meta.json` and replace the `url` with the URL of your hosted résumé. You can also customize the language and color scheme here.

Supported properties are:

<table></table>

## SpellCheck

If you run the project locally in development, the content of your `introduction` and `entries` will be automatically spell-checked using your system default spellcheck engine.

Possible misspelled words will be announced as warnings in the console output, like so:

```
Linter: check spelling for "incorect"
```
